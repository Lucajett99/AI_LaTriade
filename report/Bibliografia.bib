abstract = {{Among the many open problems in the learning process, students dropout is one of the most complicated and negative ones, both for the student and the institutions, and being able to predict it could help to alleviate its social and economic costs. To address this problem we developed a tool that, by exploiting machine learning techniques, allows to predict the dropout of a first-year undergraduate student. The proposed tool allows to estimate the risk of quitting an academic course, and it can be used either during the application phase or during the first year, since it selectively accounts for personal data, academic records from secondary school and also first year course credits. Our experiments have been performed by considering real data of students from eleven schools of a major University.}},

In order to exploit it as a tool supporting decision-making, such a software should be provided with information necessary for its integration into the decision-making processes of University governance. In this work, we present a predictive tool, at the state of the art, providing a functional description of its integration through practical examples. In addition, we propose a simplified scheme to guide the reasoning on the software, which we structure according to the following processes: the learning of the machine, the choice of the representation of dropout and the interpretation of the results. Finally, we share some considerations addressing education designers and institutional decision-makers on the management of interventions inspired by the prediction of freshmen academic outcome.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Modelli predittivi per politiche efficaci contro l’abbandono dell’università.&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lo sviluppo di un software per predire l’abbandono della carriera universitaria non è sufficiente affinché questo venga implementato in modo efficace nel contesto accademico. Per essere sfruttato come strumento di supporto alle decisioni, il software dovrebbe essere fornito con le informazioni necessarie alla sua integrazione nei processi decisionali della governance di ateneo. In questo lavoro, presentiamo uno strumento predittivo allo stato dell’arte, fornendone una descrizione funzionale alla sua integrazione, attraverso esempi concreti. Inoltre, proponiamo uno schema semplificato per guidare il ragionamento sul software, che strutturiamo nei seguenti processi: l’apprendimento della macchina, la scelta della rappresentazione dell’abbandono e l’interpretazione dei risultati. Infine, condividiamo alcune considerazioni rivolgendoci ai progettisti dell’educazione e agli &lt;em&gt;institutional decision-makers&lt;/em&gt; circa la gestione degli interventi ispirati dalla previsione dell’abbandono delle matricole.&lt;/p&#38;gt;}, number={3}, journal={Form@re - Open Journal per la formazione in rete}, author={Zingaro, Stefano and Del Zozzo, Agnese and Del Bonifro, Francesca and Gabbrielli, Maurizio}, year={2020}, month={Dec.}, pages={165-175}}

abstract = {Dropout and student's learning satisfaction are challenges that every higher education institution is facing all over the world. Each university conducts researches for comprehending the essentials of what determines student's dropout on one hand, and on the other hand, what determines student's learning satisfaction. Such endeavours provide great management insights into developing effective strategies that allows universities to create new opportunities and value for their students and instructors.This paper presents an integrated approach achieved within a pilot center for educational and professional development called CADEP. The CADEP acronym comes from the Spanish Centros de Apoyoy Desarrollo Educativoy Profesional, and has been setup in Bogota, Colombia at the Francisco Jos\'{e} de Caldas University in the framework of the ACACIA project. The CADEP pilot represents a best practice example for fighting dropout and enhancing student's learning satisfaction in universities.},
